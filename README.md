# Temperature_measuring
Temperature and humidity measurement station (thermistor and SHT 75) sending data via ethernet to MySQL (and then to Grafana)
This project contains:
Circuits diagram (with RTC, which I do not use, because MySQL has timestamp ability, for offline purposes I deeply recommend it!)
        like jpg file
        like fritzing file (fzz)
Arduino code
RTC odd code
php code
MySQL/Grafana example code to create a diagram
