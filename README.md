# Temperature_measuring
Temperature and humidity measurement station (thermistor and SHT 75) sending data via ethernet to MySQL (and then to Grafana)<br />
This project contains:<br />
- Circuits diagram (with RTC, which I do not use, because MySQL has timestamp ability, for offline purposes I deeply recommend it!) [jpg/fzz]<br />
- Arduino code<br />
- TC odd code<br />
- php code<br />
- MySQL/Grafana example code to create a diagram<br />
